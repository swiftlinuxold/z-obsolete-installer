The title of the installer should be "Swift Linux Installer" instead of "Linux Mint Debian Edition Installer".

All references to Linux Mint in the installation process should be replaced with Swift Linux.

When you reach the "Select where you want to install Swift Linux" page, there should also be instructions saying:
Then select the mount point by right-clicking the mouse on the Swift Linux partition.  For a conventional installation, select "Assign to /".

When you reach the Bootloader section, there should be a note saying "The default option (which doesn't specifiy the partition) means installing GRUB to the MBR.  This is the conventional option."

When you boot up after installation, the GRUB menu should show Swift Linux instead of Linux Mint.

The desktop icon for installing Swift Linux should appear on the live CD but NOT in the post-installation setup.
